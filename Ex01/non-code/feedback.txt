Exercise 1:
	Some simple documentation of the method might help
	understanding it's functionality.

# <<< Start of code
def isort(unsortiert):
	"""Sort a list of objects using the insertion sort algorithm.
	
	Some longer description here ...
	"""
# <<< End of code

	Some style-hints:
		- Mathematical operators are separated with "space" in python:
			"pos+1" should be "pos + 1"
			"pos+=1" -> "pos += 1"
		- Comments are indented the same ways as the following code.
		- There should be two blank lines between methods.
		- Don't use german "Umlaute" in code-comments.
		  It will be easier to run the code on systems with different encoding.
			The output of python running from console (Windows):
			SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\xc3' in file Ex1.py
			on line 11, but no encoding declared;
			see http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ for details
		- A "corrected" version is added as "Ex1_Style.py"

	I have added a Makefile to automate testing and running the python script.
	You can also use an IDE or other tools for this job.

	You should also use a test framework for your function tests.
	One of the simplest of them is "doctest".
	You define the test cases with the resulting output underneath
	in the documentation.
	The test case is introduced with ">>>" and the result is written below.
	Example:

# <<< Start of code
def isort(unsortiert):
	"""Sort a list of objects using the insertion sort algorithm.
	
	Some longer description here ...
	
	>>> isort([50, 50, 12, 46, 46, 55])
	[12, 46, 46, 50, 50, 55]
	
	>>> isort([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
	
	And so on ...
	"""
# <<< End of code

	The normal way of handling errors in python is to
	raise / throw an exception.
	This can be done with:
		raise TypeError("Eingabe muss eine liste sein")

	You can test if the exception is thrown in a testcase.
	The exception message has to match with the expected in the test case.
		Sorting with wrong data type:
# <<< Start of code
		  >>> isort(1)
		  Traceback (most recent call last):
		  ...
		  TypeError: Eingabe muss eine liste sein
# <<< End of code

	Nevertheless: Good job and well tested.

Exercise 2:
	Correct
