You could create a simple list of u unique values and then choose k values
with the random.sample function:

random.sample:
"Return a k length list of unique elements chosen from the population
sequence or set"

This can be combined with range() to create a set of n elements:
def create_random_universe_subset(k, u):
	return random.sample(range(u), k)

Care about the style of your code.
The lint (flake8) check reports 44 violations with 28 of them corresponding
to missing / too much empty lines and trailing / missing whitespace.
If you want to use a maximum line width of 120 characters
(this is considered the "modern" maximum line width)
you can use "--max-line-length=120" as argument to flake8:
$ flake8 *.py -v --max-line-length=120

Blank lines should be completely blank with no additional tab-/spacecharacters
in it.

You can finish doc-comments in the samle line if they are short enough:
"""Hello world"""

if-statements are not written in the same line as the following instruction(s):
	if n < 2:
		return False

Don't hesitate to ask if you need help or something is unclear.
