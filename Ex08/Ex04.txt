Ex4:

A(Quicksort) is much slower than B(insertion into hash table) 
It seems like block operations, which would be slower in algorithm B play a smaller 
role than expected in reality. This may be because of the size of Cache, which is 
sufficiently big to handle the data without too many cache misses and that even if 
a cache miss occurs, its relevance to the overall runtime is very low.
Both graphs grow almost linear.
