As expected, A(Quicksort) is much slower than B(insertion into hash table) at the 
beginning. It seems like block operations, which would be slower in algorithm B 
play a smaller role than expected in reality. This may be because of the size of 
Cache, which is sufficiently big to handle the data without too many cache misses.
