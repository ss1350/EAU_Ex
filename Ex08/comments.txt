As expected, A(Quicksort) is much slower than B(insertion into hash table)
at the beginning. It seems like block operations, which would be slower
in algorithm B play a smaller role than expected in reality. 
This is because of the size of Cache is sufficiently big to handle the data 
without too many cache misses.
