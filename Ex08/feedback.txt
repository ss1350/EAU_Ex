Exercise 1:
Number of operations: (worst case)
	Quicksort: Correct
	Non-Universal hash map:
		Since we have to check if an element is already present in our map
		we have to iterate the whole list in our single bucket.
		This results in a runtime of O(n^2).

Number of block operations: (worst case)
	Quicksort: Correct
	Non-Universal hash map: Correct

Which one is faster?: Correct

Exercise 2:
	Since an entry with the same key might already be in the bucket of your hash
	map you should check the bucket.

    def apply(self, x):
        """apply hash function specified above to a given
        key value and return hash table index
        """
        index = ((self.a * x + self.b) % self.p) % self.m
        bucket = self.table[index]
        if not x in bucket:
            bucket.append(x)

        return index

Exercise 3:
	Correct

Exercise 4:
	Correct
