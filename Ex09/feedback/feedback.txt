Exercise 1:
	Nice

Exercise 2:
	You didn't have to write an actual algorithm which runs with the runtime
	given by the recursion equation. The computation of the runtime of
	the algorithm would be sufficient.

def compute_rumtime(n):
	if n <= 1:
		return n

	return 4 * compute_rumtime(math.ceil(n/2)) + n ** 2

	With this you can plot the runtime in comparison to two functions
	(the upper limit and lower limit) and validate the runtime.

	f1 = c1 * n log(n)
	f2 = compute_rumtime(n)
	f3 = c2 * n log(n)
